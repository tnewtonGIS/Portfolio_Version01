              <p class="job-p">
                After a twenty-year military career, I took the plunge into
                academia. Soon, I found my calling to combine my love of the
                outdoors with a mapping career when I studied GIS. After years
                of attending classes and living in a cubicle, I went for an
                outdoor adventure as a park ranger. I'm now back to improving my
                coding skills as I decide where life's next adventure takes me.
                That might be to the outdoors, a return to GIS, or academia for
                a Ph.D in Geospatial Analytics. In an ideal world, I can apply
                my trades in a hybrid of field collection and GIS mapping.

                      A bad rainy hurricane day in a National Park is better
                      than a good day in a cubicle. Shenandoah's proximity to
                      D.C. allows you to meet a wide range of high-level
                      corporate leaders and senior executives, down to a
                      plumber. Knowing the trail condition makes a huge
                      difference in directing people to hikes more suited to a
                      person's abilities. The Preventative piece of SAR, done
                      correctly, can save parks hundreds of thousands of dollars
                      in future recovery costs. You can buy yourself an
                      Airstream and live in the park, listening to birds
                      chirping and deer outside your door daily.

                      If you are an introvert, PSAR is not a job for you. Being
                      a people person is imperative to delivering the PSAR
                      message. Since no national PSAR standard exists, every
                      park may or may not have health physicals or fitness
                      standards, significantly impacting a ranger's capability.
                      DOI agencies are like businesses. Some agencies sell
                      mineral, timber, grazing rights, or electrical power. The
                      Park Service sells enjoyment, which generates a small
                      budget. NPS must adhere to the Historic Preservation Act
                      for all buildings resulting in minimal to no
                      modifications. The low GS/WG payscale and seasonal months
                      make these jobs only sustainable for retired and college
                      students.

                    installing and configuring applications, automating
                    workflows with model builder, writing custom Python or R
                    scripts, designing GIS curricula and workshops, and
                    supporting customer engagements at conferences. My federal

                      You will not find a more concentrated workforce of
                      professional geo-centric scientists who are passionate
                      about everything maps. The exposure to all of Esri's
                      products, internal courses, and inside knowledge are
                      shared to make you a professional in your area of focus.
                      You will never be saddled with external distractions from
                      creating maps and apps. You jump from one project to the
                      next, taking the skills learned to make a better product
                      for the next customer. Every position and team is
                      different at Esri, but I was fortunate to have awesome
                      bosses and colleagues with whom I could collaborate
                      remotely and in the office. To sum Esri up, it's the

                      All Esri offices are in high-cost-of-living cities, so you
                      need to do a cost analysis to see if the juice is worth
                      the squeeze. While Esri does have conferences, you have to
                      work at Esri for a while before you can attend, even if
                      the conference is within driving distance. Before covid,
                      Esri employees would work with on-site customers to teach
                      or establish GIS systems. Post covid, government agencies
                      and civilian companies moved to remote conference. Can you

                    As part of NASA’s Applied Sciences Program, DEVELOP
                    addresses environmental and policy concerns by practically
                    applying NASA Earth observations. DEVELOP projects apply
                    Earth observations to the application areas of Agriculture,
                    Disasters, Ecological Forecasting, Energy, Health and Air
                    Quality, Transportation and infrastructure, urban
                    development, and Water Resources. These projects highlight
                    NASA Earth observation capabilities relative to
                    environmental issues and concerns for enhanced policy and
                    decision-making to improve life here on Earth. Our
                    development team integrated Google Earth Image Landsat7 and
                    Sentinel imagery with Esri Model Builder to determine winter
                    decline signals over twenty years across four states. The
                    team concentrated on Hemlock detection as these evergreen
                    species are more fire resilient and improve stream quality.
                    Our team successfully developed models to find hemlock
                    locations and delivered training tutorials to allow the
                    Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians to expand their GIS program

                      My cons are the circumstances resulting from covid. All
                      2020 teams were moved to remote work at the last minute
                      and did not experience in-person collaboration. The
                      two-day live training in R programming that we received as
                      part of the program came so fast and furious it provided
                      no value. If you already have an extensive programming
                      language or know R, then this training can be applied to
                      your research. Would I do this again remotely? Then NO; if
                      I did it in person, then YES.

                    The mission of Global Treks focuses on experiential
                    education opportunities for students wishing to expand their
                    learning outside of the classroom. The Global Treks
                    Internship Program was launched to provide students with a 3
                    ½ month experience combining action research, field data
                    collection, and concluding with the publication writing
                    process. The internship opportunity connects each student's
                    academic journey to a research project for publication. All
                    research collected is professionally written and published
                    in a cultural guide or field guide to a remote part of the
                    world. The 2019 Rarotonga Expedition land trek continues to
                    build sustainable relationships with diverse communities
                    around the island. As the sole Geospatial Intern
                    representative, you are responsible for items related to
                    collection, interpretation, analysis, and product delivery
                    to publication. You will also be assigned additional duties
                    for UAV imagery and video collection for short movie clips.
                    Devise a way to map lagoon imagery with or without GRS
                    panels accurately. You must ensure QA/QC standards match
                    Cook Island collection data to the correct grid coordinate
                    reference and projection systems while representing
                    spatially accurate 3d enhanced imagery and contour profiles.

                    As the largest United States military branch, we defend our
                    nation's freedom and safety and provide stability during
                    challenging times. Freedom has been a focus since 1775, when
                    the Army's fight for independence began. Today, the Army
                    honors a legacy of freedom and leads by example with core
                    values that every Soldier lives by. As a soldier, I trained
                    in various military-related tasks, including administrative,
                    combat, communications, humanitarian functions, leadership,
                    medical, peacekeeping duties, and teaching forces around the
                    globe. While serving as a soldier, I lived the Army's core
                    values of Loyalty, Duty, Respect, Selfless Service, Honor,
                    Integrity, and Personal Courage. Today, the Army employs
                    over 450,000 active duty soldiers, ready to protect America.

                      with men already disqualified by health problems or mental
                      health issues, have limited eligible recruits. Those
                      looking for a stable family life will often be interrupted
                      by deployments in various lengths. Plan to miss many
                      birthdays and holidays at the cost of the greater good.

          <p class="foot-p">
            This website was built with pure HTML5, CSS, and Javascript.
            Previous versions included Bootstrap5, nodeJS, and SASS. Future
            upgraqdes will incorporate Leaflet and ChartJS. My portfolio was a
            culmination of developer courses taken at Udemy.
