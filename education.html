Have you ever wanted to better understand your own eating habits and their causes and consequences? This course allows you to explore these questions and examine the personal and societal mechanisms underlying America's number one public health issue - the obesity epidemic. The course uses a social sciences lens to examine this public health crisis, and evaluates the individual and social factors that have resulted in the obesity epidemic. Students will explore why our nutritional needs no longer drive our dietary habits, and how this is exploited by the food industry. On an individual level, our appetites are stimulated by the highly addictive ingredients of sugar, fat, and salt that the food industry uses in low-priced products, while our food choices are often constrained by social and economic conditions. This results in a cycle of desire and consumption that ends with a nation of overeaters, both children and adults. Additionally, students evaluate societal factors influencing obesity, such as less emphasis on physical activity at school and at home, socioeconomic differences in diet and nutritional availability, the emergence of the internet and television as principal sources of entertainment etc. all of which lead to an increasingly sedentary modern American lifestyle. Using these analyses and information, students will identify and discuss solutions to fight back against the food industry and end overeating."

When you hear about costly wars or domestic strife in energy-rich regions like Russia or the Middle East, do you question how these might be related? Beyond the near constant power rivalry over energy, even alternative energy technologies, global climate change looms as an almost incalculable cost. In this course you develop a geopolitical lens onto energy and climate change by looking at powerful state, military and corporate actors, each pursuing its own, often conflicting, objectives. You examine how these actors influence energy geopolitics and climate change, such as in dealing with the security implications of increased sea levels, storm intensities, Arctic melt and drought.

              Automating field data and reporting for Ghana Disease Mitigation
            </h4>
            <h5 class="ed-text">Problem</h5>
            <p class="ed-p">
              Ghana, Africa, located near the equator, struggles to control
              neglected tropical diseases (NTD) in rural areas. USAID teamed up
              with the Ghana Ministry of Health to enhance the country's
              treatment program by establishing a yearly mass drug
              administration (MDA) since 2006. Since the initial distribution,
              tracking has been through paper records, leading to accountability
              issues in the number of people treated. FHI360, a Durham, North
              Carolina company, was awarded USAID and Gates Foundation grants to
              design, train, and implement a pilot program for electronic
              tracking. FHI360 requested help automating a system that could
              aggregate the field data and display it in a web application for
              the Ghana health workers to track daily progress.
            </p>
            <h5 class="ed-text">Analysis Procedures</h5>
            <p class="ed-p">
              The raw data would be delivered nightly as a CSV file from the GPS
              "Tally Counter" device. The data required identifying key
              attributes representing a new contact point (home or road
              intersection). Each subsequent person after that would represent
              multiple people at that location, as the GPS device would mark
              each person with a series of attributes. The data would require
              aggregating each person to an area, collecting mean GPS
              coordinates for the location, create new tables to represent
              various statistics in a web application. Due to COVID restrictions
              in Ghana, the testing was delayed, so I designed a script to
              automate the incoming random data of the collectors. The following
              script cleaned all the data and pushed it into tables, while the
              final script pushed those CSV files to a PostgreSQL server.
              Scripting is written with R, and Esri model builder created
              geoprocesing tools embedded in the Esri web app builder (WAB) that
              would allow Ghana health officials to export the information as
              shape files for future needs. A secondary internal WAB displays
              metrics for investors and USAID to monitor progress.
            </p>
            <h5 class="ed-text">Results</h5>
            <p class="ed-p">
              Beta testing ensures the data will be written from start to finish
              and ready for field collectors to begin uploading collection data.
              The web application does multiple operations, which will help
              distribute and target more households for treatment. Queries allow
              viewing of medication refusals or people not found. They can view
              daily results or overall results. Pill icons help keep track of
              total pharmacy numbers. Age, gender, and refusal locations help
              workers create target campaigns to address community concerns. A
              pattern analysis tool, not discussed yet, finds the hot spot
              clusters of refusals, displays the directional tendency of
              households, and creates a median location valid for support cells
              in distribution. The project met all the end user requirements
              with additional relevant and beneficial features to the project
              partners.

              Cartography is a discipline on its own, separate from geospatial
              analytics. Analog maps in universities are often used just as a
              way to show results. The Vietnam map was an Esri MOOC I found so
              fun. I took it twice and put my military spin on it the second
              time.

              The Pacific Ocean is home to dozens of low-lying countries.
              America Samoa was chosen for its access to available NOAA LIDAR
              datasets. The purpose was to understand the displacement of people
              from their homes and the potential loss of farmland due to
              salination.

              I focused on the Pago Pago Bay area to see the impact on the
              seaport, which is how the island receives most of its food source.
              Census data at block and tract levels were aggregated to buildings
              based on sqft to estimate the number of people per building. NAIP
              rasters were used in farmland designation. Using Lidar and fishnet
              grids, a tension spline modeled the sea height within the bay. A
              15mm yearly sea rise published by the IPCC was used for decade
              encroachment.
            </p>
            <h5 class="ed-text">Results</h5>
            <p class="ed-p">
              From 2021 to 2100, sea rise will not affect America Somoa. There
              are 58 buildings (1.97% of structures) in Pago Pago Bay affected,
              as most are built at higher elevations. Impacts on structures may
              be reduced with seawalls or increased dredging. Farming land in
              Pago Pago makes up only .677%, and the impacted land is .002%.
              Agricultural land is located on the southwest side of the island,
              where the topography is generally flat and at a greater distance.

              During segregation, historic black communities were built in
              undesirable land plots such as Raleigh's 1954 southeast
              neighborhood. Urban sprawl has now made this community prone to
              flooding for years, and FEMA is ready to use a buyout program for
              specific homes. At the same time, the state looks at preserving
              the rest through landscape architecture techniques requiring GIS
              collection and analysis.

              Field assessment teams were split into riparian, greenway, and

              Custom vector basemaps combined multiple features as aid
              references, drastically improving load time. At the cemetery,
              collectors collected grids, images, and plot numbers. Before
              collection, I taught students UAV techniques, collected aerial
              imagery for maps, and updated DEMs. New feature classes were built
              from a collection that linked tabular information and renamed

              with analysis from the DEM showing where the most damaged historic
